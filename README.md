> An R package for automated molecular formula assignment of ultra-high resolution ESI-MS based metabolomics data

### Overview

This R package provides an automated molecular formula assignment approach for electrospray ionisation ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry (ESI-HRMS) metabolomics data. This includes data from direct and flow injection/infustion (FIE-HRMS) fingerprinting as well as liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) profiling. The approach includes correlation analysis, relationship calculation, molecular formula generation and selection and graphical component selection based on adducts, isotopes and transformations.

### Installation

The `assignments` package can be installed from GitHub using the
following:

``` r
remotes::install_github('aberHRML/assignments')
```

### Learn more

The package documentation can be browsed online at
